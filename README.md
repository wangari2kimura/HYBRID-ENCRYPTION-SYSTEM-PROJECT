This GitHub repository presents a research project focused on implementing a secure data transmission channel for Internet of Things (IoT) based automated lot systems. The project leverages robust hybrid encryption algorithms to safeguard sensitive data collected by IoT sensors during transmission to a central server for analysis.

Background
The proliferation of IoT devices in automated lots has introduced a critical security challenge. Data collected by these sensors, essential for predictive maintenance, is often transmitted through unsecured channels. This vulnerability exposes the data to potential breaches and unauthorized access, potentially compromising the integrity and reliability of the entire system.

Project Objectives
This project aims to develop a secure and efficient data transmission channel for conveying sensor data in IoT automated lots. By integrating robust hybrid encryption, the project seeks to achieve the following objectives:

Ensure Data Confidentiality and Integrity: Implement robust encryption algorithms to protect transmitted data from unauthorized access and manipulation throughout its journey.
Mitigate Security Risks: Address inherent vulnerabilities in data transmission channels by establishing secure communication pathways.
Enhance System Reliability: Foster trust and reliability in the automated lot system by safeguarding critical data used for predictive maintenance operations.
Technical Approach
The project employs a hybrid encryption approach, combining the strengths of both symmetric and asymmetric encryption methodologies:

Symmetric Encryption (e.g., AES): Offers efficient encryption of large data volumes using a shared secret key. Ideal for encrypting the sensor data itself.
Asymmetric Encryption (e.g., RSA): Provides a secure mechanism for key exchange due to its computationally expensive nature. Used for securely transmitting the symmetric key.
This combined approach offers a robust solution that:

Provides strong data encryption: Protects the sensor data from unauthorized access or modification.
Ensures secure key exchange: Utilizes asymmetric encryption to securely transmit the key used for symmetric encryption, eliminating the need for pre-shared secrets.
Optimizes performance: Leverages the efficiency of symmetric encryption for bulk data while maintaining secure key exchange with asymmetric methods.
Benefits
Enhanced Data Security: Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
Improved System Reliability: Boosts trust and reliability in the automated lot system by safeguarding critical data.
Efficient Data Transmission: Combines the strengths of symmetric and asymmetric encryption for optimal performance.
